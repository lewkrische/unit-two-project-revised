    <p class="item5">Hello there, I'm a teacher who is seeking to gain the skillset of a front-end developer. I am currently 
      enrolled in the Team Treehouse tech degree program. I hope to complete the training within the next four to five months.

 <p>As of right now, I don't have much to display with regards to past work. However, this project
   will be past work in the near future.</p>

  <h2>Gardening</h2>
  <p>I've been a gardener since I was a boy and prefer vegetables over flowers. However, I'm also interested in 
    trees. However, me taking coursework from Treehouse is purely coincidental.</p>

  <h2>Philosophy</h2>
  <p>I tend to read quite a bit of Philosophy. Montaigne has influenced my quite a bit, as well as Buddhism, 
    if you want to consider it a Philosophy as well as a religion.
